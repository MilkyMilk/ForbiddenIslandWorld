Design:

Design.txt should describe each of the classes in your design, and what they all do. 
If you think it’s helpful, include an ASCII-art class diagram to show the relationships between the classes.

CLASSES:
Player:
This class represents the the fish that the player gets to control.

  Posn center      -- to represent the location of the player
  int size         -- represents the size of this player
  Color col;       -- represents the color of this player
  boolean isDead;  -- boolean that determines the state of fish. False means player is alive, true means player is dead.

BackgroundFish
This class represents the background fish that swim from one side to another and can eat or get 
eaten by the player.

  Posn center        -- represents the location of the background fish
  int size           -- represents the size of this background fish
  Color col;         -- represents the color of this background fish
  boolean movingLeft -- determines whether the fish is swiming left. Left if true, right if false.

FishGame
This class is used to create the game that the player interacts with. It uses both the Player and BackgroundFish class
This class handles rendering the scene, the ending of the game, player inputs, and on tick.

  int width = 600;     -- constant to represent the height of the scene
  int height = 600;    -- constant to represent the width of the scene
  int maxSize = 75;    -- constant to determine the largest size a backgroundFish can be
  Player player;       -- player is the occurance of the player class to represent the player that the user controls
  BackgroundFish b1;   -- represents BackgroundFish
  BackgroundFish b2;   -- represents BackgroundFish
  BackgroundFish b3;   -- represents BackgroundFish
  BackgroundFish b4;   -- represents BackgroundFish
  BackgroundFish b5;   -- represents BackgroundFish
